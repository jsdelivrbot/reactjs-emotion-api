# reactjs-emotion-api

This is a front-end app written in reactJS to test the WATSON API.

The context: Shakespeareâ€™s play Henry IV part I scripts are metered and have their emotion value scored according to the rating given by the WATSON Emotion API.

Actors and the emotion graphs are displayed.

A sample output is shown in the 'sample out screenshot.png'.

This is still a work in progress.
To dos:
  - Enable to work the Axios RESTful query without any cross-site issue.
  - Improve the look and feel
  - Add the script view that is currently playing
  - Add unit tests
