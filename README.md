# reactjs-emotion-api

This is a front-end app written in reactJS to test the IBM WATSON API.

The context:

Shakespeareâ€™s play Henry IV part I scripts are metered and have their emotion value scored according to the rating given by the IBM WATSON EMOTION API.

Actors and emotion graphs are displayed.

A sample output is shown in the 'sample out screenshot.png'.

To run: 
  - download the source codes (node modules dependency is already provided)
  - navigate to the app directory and enter 'npm start' in CLI
  - run the http://localhost:8080/ in the browser and click the Play button


This is still a work in progress.
To dos:
  - Improve the look and feel
  - Add view(s) to show the script that is currently playing
  - Add unit tests

Caveat:
  Access to the IBM WATSON API server has expired, thus the response payload is simulated as random decimal numbers that corresponds to each emotion graph.
